Neosam's screencast scripts.  Use it, share it, do whatever you like.
These are tested under Ubuntu Linux.

screencast.sh:  Use this script to create a picture every x seconds.
                Pictures filenames will be <unixtime>.jpg so you can
		terminate and restart the script without problems.
		Needs scrot to take screenshots.

cropvideo.sh:   If you want a specific area of your desktop
		on your video you can run this script after you have run
		screencast.sh.  You should backup your image files before
		using this script :).
		Needs ImageMagick.

createvideo.sh: Takes all your jpeg files and store them into a movie.
     		Needs mencoder.

If you have questions on these scripts you can contact me at neosam@gmail.com

Cheers,
neosam.
